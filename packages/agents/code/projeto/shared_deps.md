# Plan
We are going to create a simple protobuf file for a User message. Protobuf, or Protocol Buffers, is a method of serializing structured data, developed by Google. It's useful for developing programs to communicate with each other over a wire or for storing data. The method involves an interface description language that describes the structure of some data and a program that generates source code from that description for generating or parsing a stream of bytes that represents the structured data.

Here, the task is to create a protobuf file that defines a User message, with fields `id` (integer) and `name` (string).

## YAML Description
```yaml
- filename: user.proto
  description: A protobuf file for a User message. Contains two fields, id and name.
  variables: 
    - id: An integer field representing the user's id.
    - name: A string field representing the user's name.
  messageNames:
    - User: The message representing a user's data.
  functionNames: None
```

## File Structure

### user.proto
```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

message User {
  int32 id = 1; // user's id
  string name = 2; // user's name
}
```
In this protobuf file, we're defining a `User` message with two fields, `id` and `name`. The `id` field is an integer and the `name` field is a string. The numbers 1 and 2 are the identifiers for these fields. They will be used in the serialized message for identifying the data elements. Each field must be associated with a unique number. These numbers will be used to identify your fields in the message binary format, and should not be changed once your message type is in use.
